3. Database: Laravel supports database MySQLSQL Server. You need to have your preferred database server installed and configured. Ensure that you have the necessary drivers installed and enabled in your PHP configuration.
4. Node.js and NPM (Optional): If your Laravel application utilizes front-end React technology, you'll need to have Node.js and NPM (Node Package Manager) installed to manage and install JavaScript dependencies.
